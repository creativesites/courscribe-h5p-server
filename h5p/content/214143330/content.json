Compliance with these regulations is essential for trucking businesses to operate legally and responsibly.             Section 2: Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) Regulations:             FMCSA is the primary agency responsible for regulating the trucking industry in the United States. Some of its key regulations include the Hours of Service (HOS) rules, drug and alcohol testing, and electronic logging device (ELD) requirements.             Section 3: Department of Transportation (DOT) Regulations:             DOT regulations focus on ensuring the safe and secure movement of freight through highways, railways, and airways. DOT requires that all transporters have operating authority, motor carrier identification, and a USDOT number.             Section 4: International Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA):             IFTA is an agreement among states and provinces in the United States and Canada that regulates the reporting and payment of fuel taxes by commercial motor carriers. Carriers operating in multiple jurisdictions must obtain an IFTA license and file quarterly tax returns.             Section 5: Types of Permits, Inspections, and Certifications:             The trucking industry requires obtaining various permits, inspections, and certifications to legally operate. These include fuel permits, overweight permits, annual safety inspections, and commercial driver's licenses, among others.</p>\n"},"library":"H5P.AdvancedText 1.1","metadata":{"contentType":"Text","license":"U","title":"Section 1: Introduction to Legal and Regulatory Requirements:","authors":[],"changes":[]},"subContentId":"e6d7d3ce-b936-458c-be2b-6fc37ea2be2e"},"useSeparator":"auto"}]},"library":"H5P.Column 1.16","subContentId":"3f3e0a76-fa41-4d57-8121-b14f14444883","metadata":{"contentType":"Column","license":"U","title":"Introduction","authors":[],"changes":[],"extraTitle":"Introduction"}},{"params":{"content":[{"content":{"params":{"text":"<p>Private Fleets:<br />\n </p>\n\n<p>Private fleets refer to companies that own and operate their trucks.
